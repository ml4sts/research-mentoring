## Student Outcomes
Identify several outcomes (skills, knowledge, professional development, etc.) that are important for the student to develop through the completion of this project. Use these questions to get you started: What does the student want to get out of this research experience?  What does the mentor want the student to get out of the experience?

<!-- Example skills outcomes:
Can identify relevant sources from library databases.
Learn to operate a thermocycler to complete PCR.
Can successfully use Final Cut Pro to edit my film.
Example content knowledge outcomes:
Be able to compare/contrast 3 different scholars' interpretations of "Brave New World."
Be able to summarize the latest research about the causes of depression among the elderly.
Be able to explain and understand the concepts behind the PCR technique and its application to the lab's work.

Example professional development outcomes:
To show my artwork in a gallery.
To attend a professional conference.
To create a writing sample/portfolio for graduate school applications.
To help me decide on my career options. -->
