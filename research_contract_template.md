## Project Overview

The larger project's overall goal is to:



People and Roles
 - Sarah Brown:
 - <student>:
 - <domain expert>:


## Research Milestones
Identify several tasks that the student should aim to accomplish as s/he moves toward completing the project, including a tentative schedule.  Be sure to include any product, such as a paper, creative work, or presentation, that the student is expected to complete by the end of the semester. (Add more fields as needed).

<!-- Example Research Milestones:
Identify six articles to read.
Successfully clone gene of interest.
Administer survey.
Submit proposal to present at Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Turn in the first draft for a final paper. -->

[Create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests) your milestones as [GithHub milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones). Associate a target date and short description to each. 


## Student Outcomes
Identify several outcomes (skills, knowledge, professional development, etc.) that are important for you to develop through the completion of this project. Use these questions to get you started: What do you want to get out of this research experience?  What does the mentor want the student to get out of the experience?

<!-- Example skills outcomes:
Can identify relevant sources from library databases.
Learn to operate a thermocycler to complete PCR.
Can successfully use Final Cut Pro to edit my film.
Example content knowledge outcomes:
Be able to compare/contrast 3 different scholars' interpretations of "Brave New World."
Be able to summarize the latest research about the causes of depression among the elderly.
Be able to explain and understand the concepts behind the PCR technique and its application to the lab's work.

Example professional development outcomes:
To show my artwork in a gallery.
To attend a professional conference.
To create a writing sample/portfolio for graduate school applications.
To help me decide on my career options. -->

Outcome 1:
Student level at start of project: (no experience, beginning, adequate, advanced)
Student level at end of project: (no experience, beginning, adequate, advanced)

Outcome 2:
Student level at start of project: (no experience, beginning, adequate, advanced)
